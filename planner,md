# Planner — Agentic AI Project 2 (Workflow Agent)

## Project Name
**Agentic AI Project 2 — Workflow Agent**

## Repo
`agentic-workflow-agent`

## Goal
Build a user-friendly **autonomous workflow agent** that can:
**Resume → JD → Skill Gap → Plan → Rewrite → Self-Review**
and generate a downloadable **JSON report**.

This project demonstrates:
- workflow automation
- stateful multi-step reasoning (agentic output)
- structured outputs
- practical career workflow use case

---

## Core Workflow (Single Workflow Only)
✅ Resume → JD → Skill Gap → Plan → Rewrite → Self-Review

No mixing with other workflows.

---

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- OpenAI API
- Pydantic (validation)
- Streamlit UI
- JSON output export

---

## Constraints Followed
- ✅ No RAG
- ✅ No Embeddings
- ✅ No Vector DB
- ✅ No LangChain / CrewAI
- ✅ No async pipelines

Reason: keep the system clean, lightweight, and portfolio-friendly.

---

## Deliverables

  ```bash
  python -m app.main
Output:
